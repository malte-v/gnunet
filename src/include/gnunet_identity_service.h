 * Identity management.
 *
 * Egos in GNUnet are ECDSA keys.  You assume an ego by using (signing
 * with) a particular private key.  As GNUnet users are expected to
 * have many egos, we need an identity service to allow users to
 * manage their egos.  The identity service manages the egos (private
 * keys) of the local user; it does NOT manage egos of other users
 * (public keys).  For giving names to other users and manage their
 * public keys securely, we use GNS.
